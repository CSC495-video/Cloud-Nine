Welcome to Stream Scam, the streaming service that’s so good, it has to be illegal — but probably isn’t. We specialize in the strange, the forgotten, the addictive, and the absolutely unhinged. From bizarre indie films and nostalgic throwbacks to reality TV disasters and “totally legit” documentaries, Stream Scam offers the kind of content other platforms are too scared to touch. We’re not here to play by the rules — we’re here to entertain, surprise, and maybe confuse you just a little. With a suspiciously good catalog, zero commitment, and a 7-day free trial (or until the authorities say otherwise), we promise you’ll be hooked before you even figure out what’s going on. So hit play, dive deep, and remember: the only scam is missing out.
